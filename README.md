# Stata-Code-Sample
In this code sample, I use a subset of the dataset used by Schindler &amp; Westcott (2021) in their Shocking Racial Attitudes: Black G.I.s in  Europe (https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/88/1/489/5880000) study.
 The sample contains Stata code that merges two datasets and then aggregates the data to a lower level. It then uses .shp files and basemap files to create maps of the UK plotting the variation in a specific variable according to postcode. I also aggregate the data according to binary values of a different variable and use to generate a summary table with my results. I run T-tests to find the statistical significances of these binary sorted averages. I then run certain regressions and use the outreg2 command to output the results in a tabular form to LaTeX.
